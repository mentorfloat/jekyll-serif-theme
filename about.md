We can be too busy with our lives sometimes and not have time to cook every single day.

Imagine having access to ready-meals prepared by the same chefs that you love from your local restaurants, at home, whenever you need it.

## Eating well can be easy and cheap

You don't have to sacrifice time, money and effort to eat well throughout the week.

You can take heart in knowing that our meals are cooked by real chefs and the menu is carefully selected to achieve a nutritious and balanced diet.

No more meal-prep Sundays or expensive delivery fees every day!

Our partnered restaurants prepare the meals in small batches and we will deliver them in a temperature-controlled box to you once a week. Talk about being efficient!

## Support the local restaurants that you love

Unlike the people from San Francisco, we don't just walk in and take from Aussie businesses.
We partner with local restaurant owners and chefs to curate the ideal menu to suit our subscription model.

We approach it as a partnership.

## Enjoy a delicious culinary experience, at home

There's always a story behind each restaurant. Why did the restaurateur started it? What are the values and visions? They share these stories through their food.

We aim to bring these amazing local stories to the community, no matter the situation around us.
